				<h2>What I'm Working on Now:</h2>
				<p>Since spring semester started, I've been working on my creativity and how I can improve how I work. Because I am going into a creative field, I want to be able to create more consistantly instead of in spurratic bursts like I do now. Other than just all around mental health work, I've been working with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Artists-Way-25th-Anniversary/dp/0143129252">"The Artists Way"</a> by Julia Cameron. </p>
				<p>Following the book you go week by week and you complete:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Morning pages (writing 3 pages every morning about anything)</li>
					<li>Writing/Reading from the book</li>
					<li>Artist Dates (once a week you go out alone and do something for your inner artist)</li>
				</ul>

				It's interesting to see how working through the writing prompts and reading, is helping in my work in the audio field as a creative.</p>
