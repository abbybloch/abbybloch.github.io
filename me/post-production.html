				<h3>Background</h3>
				<p>I have always loved the sound in film (or more specifically the music). When I was little, the sound/music in a scary scene would be what frightened me. I learned that if I plugged my ears, I could keep my eyes (mostly) open and be a lot less scared. As I got older I became more and more interested in that concept and looked into working in some way with films. Originally, I wanted to do something with the score but I have never been very excited to compose music (other than imporvising on guitar or piano) so I ruled that out pretty quickly. The next thought was to be the recording engineer who would record and mix the score. Up until freshman year of college, that was what I was planning on doing, but then I leanred more about post-production audio. In my audio for video class spring 2020, I learned about dialog recording and editing, sound design, effects editing, foley, and everything that goes into just making the sounds in a scene. I fell in love with it and have been on that path ever since. However, I am still learning everyday and there are still many fasets of the production industry that I have yet to explore that may capture my heart more.</p>

				<h3>My Projects</h3>
				<p>During my year off, my audio for video professor Spencer Shafter helped mentor me so I could continue learning about the industry while I was at home. I was able to work on my own project that I am still currently finishing up as well as a short film. I had to go through the different microphone recordings from set and listen for which ones sounded the best ofr each character whenever they were speaking. It was a really cool process and I got to dip my toe into the industry itself and the pace at which it runs.</p>
