		<p>This was a project to showcase ADR and some effects aditing and foley. The sound was stripped from the clip and completeky replaced. The car locking and unlocking sounds were recorded using a zoom recorder and my car. The other sound effects and environment sounds were found from soundly and freesounds.org and edited by myself. The M&M dialog was done by Spencer Shafter and edited by myslef. Finally, Christina Applegate's dialog was performed, recorded, and edited by myself.</p>
