				<h2>THX 2019 Deep Note Trailer</h2>
				<p>This project was completed as an exercise to sound design a clip and do soem effects editing. The sound was stripped from the original clip and replaced with new sounds. The sounds were created using everyday objects, found on Soundly and freesounds.org, and provided by my mentor. Logic soundscape sounds were alto used and edited to create some of the design. The helicopter was created using a free demo of Krotos Igniter.</p>

				<h2>Carver Halloween Parties</h2>
				<p>This was my midterm for my Audio for Video 2 class. The company and video was created by my professor Spencer Shafter and I created the audio logo (mnemonic). The "client" did not want cliche halloween sounds or dense pads. I created an overall eerie energy to the clip with the backgrounds and used more of a wet sound for the rorschach test images as they morph. I included a human element with the breath as the logo appears which can also be used on its own outside the contect of the whole clip. The logo holds for a long time at the end so I included the footsteps to door slam to create a sonic ending for the clip. The sounds were recorded by myself and found on soundly</p>
