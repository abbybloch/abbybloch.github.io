      <main>
      	<p> The main theme (later becoming Hedwig's Theme) composed by John Williams in the Harry Potter series is quite well known now, but when Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone came out, it was just found in the prologue and as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitmotif">leitmotif</a> used throughout the movie. Beginning at the Warner Bros logo and throughout the rest of the movie, the motif represents the magic in the wizarding world.</p>

      	<p><img 
      		id="movie" 
      		width= "510" height = "755"
      		src="images/harry-potter.jpg" 
      		srcset = "images/harry-potter.jpg 510w, images/harry-potter-x2.png 1020w"
        	sizes="(max-width: 510px) 510px, (min-width: 511px) 1020px"
      		alt="The cover art for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone Movie" 
      		></p>

		<p>The leitmotif helps narrate the movie by giving insight into the magic and when it appears. Also, as the instrumentation changes, the audience is clued into the type of magic and it’s context. The celesta is light and is often used when the magic is in the world or the scene in general, such as the owls dropping off letters or Harry finding out he is a wizard. Other instances of the brass, woodwinds, or strings being used give the emotional side of the magic in the scene. They tend to blend in more with the score for the overall scene to keep with an urgent or emotional scene. The leitmotif is also often used in snippets or altered tempos, like the scene with Hermione lighting Snape’s cloak on fire. By using just a few notes of the leitmotif, it allows the audience to recognize what is being played without it taking over the scene.</p>
